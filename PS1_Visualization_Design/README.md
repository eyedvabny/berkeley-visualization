# Visualization Design
In this assignment, you will design a visualization for a small data set and provide a rigorous rationale for your design choices. You should in theory be ready to explain the contribution of ''every pixel'' in the display. You are free to use any graphics or charting tool you please--including drafting it by hand. However, you may find it most instructive to create the chart from scratch using a graphics API of your choice.

## Worldwide Disasters 1900 - 2008
[The Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters](http://www.emdat.be/database) makes historical data on disasters that have occurred across the world available. You will work with a subset of this data containing all disasters from 1900 to 2008 that killed more than 100 people.

We excluded disasters for which the number of people killed was unknown from the full set of worldwide disasters occurring between 1900 to 2008 . We also excluded disasters that did not kill more than 100 people. We have created separate columns containing the month, date, and year information for the start and end dates. (Note that not all disasters have a month or day for the start and end dates, but all disasters do have a year for the start and end)..

##Assignment
Your task is to design a static (i.e., single image) visualization that you believe effectively communicates this data and provide a short write-up (no more than 4 paragraphs) describing your design. While you must use the data set given, note that you are free to filter, transform and augment the data as you see fit to highlight the elements that you think are most important in the data set.

As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, you should document what aspects of the data you are attempting to most effectively communicate. In short, what story (or stories) are you trying to tell? Just as important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured or down-played due to your visualization design.

In your write-up, you should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions. Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data. These decisions include the choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as the use of sorting or other data transformations. How do these decisions facilitate effective communication?

Be sure to include a short description of the tools you used to create the visualization.
